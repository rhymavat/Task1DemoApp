## Task 2: Designing and Implementing UI/UX

### Overview
In Task 2, I focused on designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the Android app using Jetpack Compose. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that aligns with modern design principles.

### What I did
- Created wireframes and mockups for the app screens to plan layout and styling.
- Implemented UI components such as Buttons, TextFields, and Navigation using Jetpack Compose.
- Applied themes and colors to improve app appearance and maintain consistency.
- Ensured the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Developed two main screens:
   - **Welcome Screen:** A welcome message with gradient background, icon, and a navigation button.
   - **Second Screen:** A simple screen showing text content with styled surface and layout.

### Challenges & Learnings
- Learned to use Jetpack Compose for modern Android UI development.
- Understood the importance of theming and styling for better UX.
- Practiced navigation between screens using Compose Navigation.
- Improved my UI/UX design skills by integrating wireframes into real code.
